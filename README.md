## Architecture

### PDF Processing Pipeline
1. **Document Loading**: Uses LangChain's PDFLoader for initial text extraction
2. **Text Processing**: Implements recursive character splitting with context preservation
3. **Metadata Extraction**: Identifies parts, sections, subsections, amendments, and related references
4. **Chunking Strategy**: Uses overlapping windows for context preservation
5. **Vector Storage**: Efficiently stores embeddings in Pinecone with metadata

### Chat System
1. **Query Processing**: Enhanced search queries with legal context
2. **Vector Search**: Semantic search with score-based filtering and deduplication
3. **Response Generation**: Context-aware responses using Cohere's chat model
4. **Citation System**: Automatic section and subsection citations
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures and invalid queries

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/condochatty.git
   cd condochatty
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Copy the example environment file and fill in your API keys:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:
   ```env
   COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
   PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your_pinecone_environment
   PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=your_index_name
   PINECONE_HOST=your_pinecone_host
   ```

5. Create a Pinecone index:
   - Dimensions: 1024 (for Cohere embed-english-v3.0 model)
   - Metric: Cosine similarity
   - Pod type: Starter or higher based on your needs

6. Place your Ontario Condo Act PDF:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p data
   # Copy your condo-act.pdf to data/condo-act.pdf
   ```

7. Process and index the PDF:
   ```bash
   # Reset existing index (if needed)
   npm run reset-index
   
   # Process and index the PDF
   npm run index-pdf
   
   # Or use the combined reindex command
   npm run reindex
   ```

8. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
